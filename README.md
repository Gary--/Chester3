# Chester3
Implementation of a Chess AI in Visual C++. Compiles with Visual Studio 2013.

The engine implements the Universal Chess Interface (UCI). You'll need a program such as GUI Arena Chess (www.playwitharena.com).

The default build is for testing as a Static library. To build the executable, switch the project type of Engine to .exe and unload Engine.Tests.
